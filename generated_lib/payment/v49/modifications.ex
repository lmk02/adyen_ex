  Cancel or refund a payment

  Cancels a payment if it has not been captured yet, or refunds it if it has already been captured. This is useful when it is not certain if the payment has been captured or not (for example, when using auto-capture).

  Do not use this endpoint for payments that involve:
   * [Multiple partial captures](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture).
   * [Split data](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-platforms/processing-payments#providing-split-information) either at time of payment or capture for Adyen for Platforms.

   Instead, check if the payment has been captured and make a corresponding [`/refund`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/Payment/refund) or [`/cancel`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/Payment/cancel) call.

  Capture an authorisation

  Captures the authorisation hold on a payment, returning a unique reference for this request. Usually the full authorisation amount is captured, however it's also possible to capture a smaller amount, which results in cancelling the remaining authorisation balance.

  Payment methods that are captured automatically after authorisation don't need to be captured. However, submitting a capture request on these transactions will not result in double charges. If immediate or delayed auto-capture is enabled, calling the capture method is not necessary.
