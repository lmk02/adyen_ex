  Create an authorisation

  Creates a payment with a unique reference (`pspReference`) and attempts to obtain an authorisation hold. For cards, this amount can be captured or cancelled later. Non-card payment methods typically don't support this and will automatically capture as part of the authorisation.

  > This endpoint is [inactive](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/upgrade-your-integration#checkout-api-lifecycle) and is no longer supported for new integrations.
  > * If you are building a new integration, use the Checkout API [`/payments`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/payments) endpoint instead.
  > * If you have an existing integration using this endpoint, reach out to your Adyen contact and [migrate to the Checkout API](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/upgrade-your-integration/migrate-to-checkout-api).

  >The Checkout API enables your [online payments](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments) integration to accept all supported payment methods, use the latest features, and access more benefits.
